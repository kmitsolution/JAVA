## Collection

Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known as collection of objects.eg collection of books,movies etc.

## Framework
A framework is set of classes and interfaces which provides a ready-made architecture.

## Collection Framework
Collection Framework is a java API (Collection of classes and interfaces) which provides an architecture to store and manipulate group of objects(predefined implemenation on the basis of algorithm).

### Collection Framework Hierarchy

All the classes and interfaces of the collection framework are in <b>java.util</b> package. This hierarchy for the collection framework specifically mentioned the class and interface with respect to each type.

#### Iterable Interface
The Iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes because the Collection interface extends the Iterable interface, therefore, all the subclasses of Collection interface also implement the Iterable interface.

The iterable interface contains only one abstract method.

Iterator iterator(): It returns the iterator over the elements of type T.

### Iterator Interface
The iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.

### Collection Interface
The Collection interface builds the foundation for the Collection framework. The collection interface is one of the interfaces which is implemented by all the Collection framework classes. It provides common methods to implement by all the subclasses of collection interfaces.

### List Interface
List interface is the subtype/child interface of the Collection interface. It stores objects/elements in list type data structure in ordered form and also allowed duplicate values.

Implementation classes for List interface are ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

For Example: To instantiate List Interface with Implementation classes follow:

```java
List  list1= new ArrayList();  
List  list2 = new LinkedList();  
List  list3 = new Vector();  
List  list4 = new Stack();
```

</ul>

```java
Queue q1 = new PriorityQueue();  
Queue q2 = new ArrayDeque();  
```
### PriorityQueue
The PriorityQueue class implements the Queue interface.
<ul>
  <li>PriorityQueue holds the elements or objects which are to be processed by their priorities.</li>
  <li> PriorityQueue doesn’t allow null values to be stored in the queue.</li>
</ul>

### Deque Interface

Deque stands for the double-ended queue which allows us to perform the operations at both ends.interface extends the Queue interface.
<ul>
  <li> Deque extends the Queue interface.</li>
  <li> Deque allows remove and add the elements from both the side.</li>
</ul>  
```java
  Deque d = new ArrayDeque(); 
```  

### ArrayDeque Class
ArrayDeque class implements the Deque interface.
<ul>
  <li> ArrayDeque facilitates us to use the Deque.</li>
  <li>ArrayDeque allows add or delete the elements from both the ends.</li>
  <li>ArrayDeque is faster than ArrayList and has no capacity restrictions.</li>
</ul>

### Set Interface
Set Interface extends Collection Interface and present in java.util package.
<ul>
  <li>Set doesn’t allow duplicate elements or objects.</li>
  <li>Set store elements in an unordered way.</li>
  <li>Set allows only one null value.</li>
  <li>Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.</li>
</ul>

```java
 // We can create an instantiation of Set as below:

Set s1 = new HashSet();  
Set s2 = new LinkedHashSet();  
Set s3 = new TreeSet();
```
